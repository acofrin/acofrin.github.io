            <h4>Gentrificatioin</h4>
            <p>Although gentrification has been studied extensively from multiple disciplinary perspectives (mpls), it is a phenomena that does not have a concrete definition or outcome. It is commonly connotation as a negative interaction; however,  even low-income households that worry about gentrification are frequently in favor of neighborhood improvement, but show active concern of displacement(mpls). Because of the lack of a concrete definition, a number of different measures of gentrification have been used by researchers in differing formats. The three factors that were used to gauge gentrification in this case were income, percent of people with some college education, and percent of owner versus renter occupied spaces per block area in Minneapolis. I calculated principal component analysis scores of these three factors and added them to create one index score. On the map, this index score is referred to as “score of advantages” due to the recent discussions considering that gentrification itself is hard to score and has many changing factors.</p>
            <h4>Veganism</h4>
            <p>In recent years, vegan diets have been continuously portrayed as elite and expensive; while also growing popularity in primarily white privileged areas. Specifically, vegan food often comes at a higher price than other foods and is marketed towards a more middle class crowd, with more advantages. This therefore correlated to the score of advantages that I have calculated, and I wanted to watch the trends. For this analysis, I defined vegan restaurants as ones that showed up in the app “Happy Cow''. I choose to do this due to its high accessibility for people looking for vegan restaurants along with its popularity as the most used app among people who eat vegan, suggesting its accuracy according to the community. </p>

            <h4>The Future</h4>
            <p>With the aim to "celebrate, support, and preserve" the 15 lesbian bars that remained in the United States, the <a href="https://www.lesbianbarproject.com/">Lesbian Bar Project</a> began as a grassroots fundraising effort. Between October 28 and November 25, 2020, the project raised $117,504.50.</p>
            <p>The Lesbian Bar project rapidly gained <a href="https://www.lesbianbarproject.com/press">public attention</a>, including the support of celebrities such as Lea DeLaria.</p>
            <p>A core tenant of the project is not only to preserve the bars, but to allow them to thrive in the future. The project's website includes information on each remaining bar, as well as links to those bar's websites.</p>

            <h4>The History</h4>
            <p>LGBT+ bars are places of debate. While they have a long history as one of the only gathering spaces for LGBT+ people, they have also faced criticism as spaces that exclude people under the age of 21, as well as those who prefer not to drink alcohol.</p>
            <p>Those on both sides of the debate about the importance of LGBT+ bars in the modern age will agree that these bars played an important role in the history of the LGBT+ community. Organizations such as <a href="https://lesbianherstoryarchives.org/">The Lesbian Herstory Archives</a> and <a href="https://www.glbthistory.org/">The GLBT Historical Society</a> document this history.</p>
            <p>In addition to real photos and diaries, historical fiction books such as <a href="https://www.malindalo.com/lastnight"><em>Last Night at the Telegraph Club</em></a> by Malinda Lo document how lesbian bars were some of the very few places that young queer people could find community. Particularly striking to the modern reader, the characters, who live in San Francisco in 1954, have more options for lesbian bars to frequent than are available to a resident of San Francisco today.</p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>The results show that vegan restaurants that exist in 2018 that did not exist in 2020 appear in areas that are in areas that have more measured “advantages'' now than they did in 2020, while every time they are on the cusp of an area that had slightly declined in their calculated advantages (figure 1). None appeared in areas of being much more advantaged. There is also a pattern of vegan restaurants surrounding the lease advantages area with nearly none in the middle; this least advantaged center slowly closes in over time. These patterns are indicative of vegan restaurants and gentrified areas moving spatially in similar ways although further research is required to understand the interaction between the two social phenomena. On a smaller scale, the research and results are not meant to  condemn either phenomena, but rather point towards potential trends.
