                     <br>
                <p>In this visualization, I use data from Minneapolis from 2000, 2010, and 2018 to see if there are trends between gentrified areas and the emergence of veganism in the city. 
                    <br>
                <h4>Gentrificatioin</h4>
            <p>Although gentrification has been studied extensively from multiple disciplinary perspectives (Goetz, 2019), it is a phenomena that does not have a single definition or outcome. It is commonly connotation as a negative interaction; however,  even low-income households that worry about gentrification are frequently in favor of neighborhood improvement, but show active concern of displacement(Goetz, 2019). Because of the lack of a universal definition, researchers use a number of different measures of gentrification. I use three factors to gauge gentrification: income, percent of people with some college education, and percent of owner versus renter occupied spaces per block area in Minneapolis. I calculated principal component analysis scores of these three factors and added them to create one index score. On the map, this index score is referred to as “score of advantages” due to the recent discussions considering that gentrification itself is hard to score and has many changing factors. Calculating gentrification in this way will show the spatial coorelation of shifting advantages in Minneapolis; maling it possible to show its potentila coorelation to vegan restaurants in the area.  </p>
            <h4>Veganism</h4>
            <p>In recent years, vegan diets have been continuously portrayed as elite and expensive; while also growing in popularity in primarily white privileged areas. Specifically, vegan food often comes at a higher price than other foods and is marketed towards a more middle class crowd, with more advantages. This therefore correlated to the score of advantages that I have calculated, and I wanted to watch the trends. For this analysis, I defined vegan restaurants as ones that showed up in the app “Happy Cow''. I choose to do this due to its high accessibility for people looking for vegan restaurants along with its popularity as the most used app among people who eat vegan, suggesting its accuracy according to the community. </p>
            <h4>The Data</h4>
            <p>Data comes from NHGIS census data and "Happy Cow"</p>

    <p> An anomaly graphic of Minneapolis “score of advantages” from 2018 to 2020. Warm colors indicate an increase in advantages over time, while cool colors indicate the opposite. This index score is referred to as “score of advantages” due to the recent discussions considering that gentrification itself is hard to score and has many changing factors. "New Restaurants" indicate restaurants that were present in 2018, and not 20000.  </p>

    <br>
    <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>The results show that vegan restaurants that exist in 2018 that did not exist in 2020 appear in areas that are in areas that have more measured “advantages'' now than they did in 2020, while every time they are on the cusp of an area that had slightly declined in their calculated advantages (figure 1). None appeared in areas of being much more advantaged. There is also a pattern of vegan restaurants surrounding the lease advantages area with nearly none in the middle; this least advantaged center slowly closes in over time. These patterns are indicative of vegan restaurants and gentrified areas moving spatially in similar ways although further research is required to understand the interaction between the two social phenomena. On a smaller scale, the research and results are not meant to  condemn either phenomena, but rather point towards potential trends. </p>
