            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>The Younger Dryas was a brief and abrupt climate event associated with a sudden cooling and drying in regions throughout the Northern Hemisphere; likely initiated by a weakening  of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). I analyze the effects of AMOC weakening and insolation seasonality on climate patterns in eastern North America using simulations of an Earth System Model. In addition to a forced weakening of the AMOC through a freshwater forcing in the North Atlantic, these simulations also include three experiments with obliquity and precession orbital parameters varied to minimize and maximize Northern Hemispheric insolation seasonality. While most of the hemisphere underwent cooling, eastern North America shows some signs of warming and increased precipitation following hosing. As Northern Hemisphere insolation seasonality is forced to increase temperature and precipitation seasonality decrease following hosing. Reduced temperature seasonality in eastern North America is a result of positive temperature anomalies in winter and a common cooling in summer across all orbital configuration experiments. Precipitation seasonality is reduced in all experiments from a common year-round wetting after hosing. These climate responses suggest that a weakening of the AMOC can ameliorate climate seasonality in some regions.</p>
